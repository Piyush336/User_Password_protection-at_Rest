# INTEL UNNATI PROGRAM 
# User_Password_protection-at_Rest(on the Disk)
# Description
1. Encrypt [AES-256] a user chosen file or directory using a random key a.k.a File Encryption Key.
2. Store the random key in a file, which has to be protected via user pass phrase.
3. The user pass phrase as well as the random key cannot be stored in plain form in the text file.

Hi there! I'm Piyush, form Team - **THE BREACHERS** and this is our Project on Cybersecurity Domain Based on Encryption and Decryption of files or folder on a disk using a Graphical User Interface. Let's dive into the features:

## ***HPJ_CRYP***
## **Application Features:**

* **🔒Password Handling✌️:**
  1. Securely prompts for user password without echoing.
  2. Confirms the password for correctness.
* **🤖🎊📄Encryption and Decryption🔓🔐:**
  1. Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CFB (Cipher Feedback) mode.
  2. Generates a random encryption key or derives it from a user-provided password and salt.
  3. Supports encryption and decryption of files and folders. 
* **📂File Handling💻:**
  1. Allows browsing and selecting files or folders for encryption or decryption.
  2. Saves encrypted data and retrieves it for decryption.
* **😵‍💫Error Handling and Feedback🚀:**
  1. Provides error messages for issues like file not found or incorrect password.
  2. Feedback on successful encryption or decryption.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI) ✅:**
  1. Includes fields for file/folder paths and buttons for browsing and actions.
  2. Displays progress bar and status messages for ongoing operations. 


### **Technologies Used:**

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* Owl Carousel Library (for Testimonials)
* jQuery (to support Owl Carousel)
* AOS Library (for cool fade effects)
* Fonts: Augustina, Rubik, Dancing Script
* Bootstrap Icons

## **Why This Web Developer Portfolio Stands Out**

* **User Experience Focus:**  The dual theme and speed optimizations show I care about delivering a great experience.
* **Attention to Detail:** Thoughtful font selections and animations add a polished touch. 
* **Real Projects:**  This isn't just about tech skills, it's about what I can build!
